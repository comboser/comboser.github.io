# WIP
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the (absurdly) cool repository of combination.
**Note**: It is worth noting that this repository is:
1. a work in progress
2. Mac OS and Linux support not out yet(but will be :wink:)
3. Use at your own risk.

If you are ready, this repository is a cursor combination of Mac OS Big Sur, KDE Breeze and Android Material Cursors(blue in color) and they are only for Windows. I am sorry, but I will figure out a method to make it available to macOS and Linux. Till then, if you wanna test this, you can download this repo and go to any of the folders, right-click on the `.inf` file and hitting `Install`. Only for Windows but I will figure it out.
